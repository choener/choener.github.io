# Theoretical Bioinformatics

We are interested in the design of *bespoke algorithms* for complex problems in bioinformatics,
biology, and biotechnology. We further the understanding of the *compositionality of algorithms*,
algebraic structures, and programming languages. In addition, we are interested in statistical
models, neural networks, and *learning algorithms*.
