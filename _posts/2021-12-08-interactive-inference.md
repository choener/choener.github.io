[Stellenmarkt for the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena](https://www4.uni-jena.de/Universit%C3%A4t/Stellenmarkt/Wissenschaftliche+Besch%C3%A4ftigte/seven+PhD+students+%28m_f_d%29+in+computer+science.html)

We invite young researchers with a masters degree in computer science, statistics, mathematics,
physics or in a related field to apply for a PhD position in the newly established research training
group "Interactive Inference" at Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany. The research training
group is funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation under the call "Scientific Breakthroughs in Artificial
intelligence".

The group unites researchers from machine learning and artificial intelligence, algorithm and
performance engineering, logic, visualization, and bioinformatics and theoretical biology with the
common goal of advancing the state of the art in artificial intelligence by scalable probabilistic
inference. More details about the research training group can be found
[here](https://inference.uni-jena.de).

The research training group offers access to a wide variety of research projects at the forefront of
artificial intelligence, each supported by at least two advisors from complementary fields. Bring
your own project: we are also open to students presenting their own project ideas. Just make sure
they fit within the general theme of interactive inference.

Jena is a beautiful city that combines diverse research institutes with a quality of life, where the
next park, restaurant, or your colleagues are just a short walk away.

Applications by [email](mailto:inference@uni-jena.de) are accepted until January 16'th, 2022 and
thereafter until all positions have been filled. 

*What is Interactive Inference?*

Reasoning under uncertainty for both, complex models and big data is an algorithmically challenging
problem that has gained more and more traction in recent years and is currently one of the main
drivers of algorithmic engineering and artificial intelligence. Within this project we want to
develop scalable algorithms for probabilistic reasoning that allow to consider uncertainty in both
data and models, and finally allow us to make informed decisions.

*TLDR, we offer*:

- research at the forefront of artificial intelligence
- a fully funded research position for up to 4 years
- advisors from at least two complementary fields
- the opportunity to graduate with a PhD in computer science 
- deadline: January 16'th 2022
- apply by [email](mailto:inference@uni-jena.de)
